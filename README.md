# Fake shop
## this is my first terrible pet-project

## Technologies: 
**React, Typescript, Redux-Toolkit, RTK Query, Tailwind**
## Functionality: 
- getting different data from server
- authorization
- search
- sorting products by category
- saving session data in local storage
and a bit more

## installation
It based on common CRA with typescript template so you need only tab to commands:
```sh
npm i (yarn)
```
 and then 
```sh
npm start (yarn start)
```
